### Well let me tell you. Did you ever hear about that AMAZING party after it happened? Perhaps your invitation got lost in the mail, perhaps they don't like you or perhaps nobody realized you have a fantastic wardrobe and witty social skills. Whatever the case we will tell you about all the hot parties in town, all the hot guys and girls that will be there. And all of the embarassing things they do when they think no one will find out.
